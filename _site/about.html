<p>Bilawa Ade Respati is a musician and performing artist based in Berlin. He
performs on the Javanese Gamelan and the guitar, composing music for both
instruments. In his practice, he incorporated elements of electronic music and
algorithmic music composition. Aside performing as a soloist, his broad
artistic interest is channeled into various collaborations.</p>

<p>Formally trained in Engineering Physics, he specializes in acoustic signal
processing and music information retrieval, especially on the analysis of
Javanese gamelan music. Parallel to his formal training as an engineer, he is
also learning classical guitar, Javanese gamelan, and music composition, from
various teachers as well as autodidacticaly.</p>

<p>In his works, he takes a syncretic approach drawing from his various
backgrounds: from engineering to performing art, from European music tradition
to the art of Javanese Karawitan. This leads to a broad artistic outputs,
ranging from music for live performance, web sound installation, to music
theater and the performing arts. His current artistic interest lies in the
dialectic between tradition and innovation, as well as the revaluation of
traditional values in contemporary life.</p>

<p>His current collaborations includes the company rubarb dance &amp; art, under the
direction of the choreographer Ruben Reniers, the visual artist and lighting
designer Emese Csornai, and the puppeteer Lisa Björkstrom. Respati performed
the gamelan with the gamelan ensemble Arum Sih (Überseemuseum Bremen), Sekar
Kenanga (Elbphilharmonie Hamburg), and Lindhu Raras (Haus der Indonesischen
Kulturen, Berlin).</p>
