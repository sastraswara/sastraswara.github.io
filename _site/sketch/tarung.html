            <h2 id="project-proposal">Project Proposal</h2>

<p>The theme of my work is musical game through the browser. I name the
work “Tarung” (Indonesian: battle) to reflect its competitive nature but
emphasizing playful aspect of it as a game. Although the players will
oppose each other, they still have to cooperate to a certain degree to
make the game “playable”. The game piece is intended to be performed
live, with audience watching the musicians playing the game.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>For me, a web browser is a window that connects us to another place.
Through this window we can interact with another person or information
regardless of our geographic position. It gives hope on the distribution
of knowledge and transcultural understanding of human kind. A game is
enjoyable and a good icebreaker. In a playful setting, one can build
interpersonal relationship and learn from each other. The process of
learning is always fun if it uses game as a media. In the shadow of war,
still existing social injustice, and many humanitarian challenge, we
need more means to make us humane that transcends political and cultural
boundaries.</p>

<h2 id="sketch-of-the-game-mechanics">Sketch of the Game Mechanics</h2>

<p>In Tarung, three musicians will participate in a game with similar
mechanism as the game Battleship.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/tarung/tarung_board.png" alt="Board" /></p>
<figcaption>A sketch of the game board, made in `p5js`.</figcaption>

<p>Two musicians take the role of opposing players, while one musician
takes the role of a judge. Two grids of 10 by 10 size are available for
each of the opposing players, on which they place their “battleships”.
The goal is for each of the musician guessing the location of the
opponents ship’s location by naming the grid coordinate, and eliminate
all of the opponent’s ship. To guess the grid, the player has to select
the grid they want to target. When selecting a grid, a digital graphical
score unique to that grid will be present to the player. The player will
has to play the digital score present to them. The opposing player will
have to answer to this played music. A digital score will be presented
to this opposing player which depends on the targeted grid. If the grid
contains part of his battleship, a “hit” phrase will be presented.
Otherwise, a “missed” phrase will be presented. The players will take
turn until one of them is running out of battleships.</p>

<p>The judge’s role is to give an “accompaniment” along with the electronic
drone part of the music. The judge will also keep track of the battle
situation among the two players, and give clear hint on the stage of the
game. The game is divided into stages corresponding to the game, cued
also by the accompanying music: The opening of the game, which is played
together, the initial stage, the climax, where at least the game is
about halfway done, the conclusion, when the game is at its decisive
moment, and the closing stage, when the game has a winner and all
musicians play together again. The generative electronic part will vary
according to the density of its sonic events and its perceived tempo.</p>

<h2 id="music-materials">Music Materials</h2>

<p>I plan to use several compositional tools available in Javanese music.
The instrumentation will be adjusted for the ensemble of the festival,
i.e., keyboards, saxophone, clarinet, and electronics. However, any type
of instrument should be able to perform it (with varying degree of
adaptation). First is the idea of the short melodic phrase (cengkok).
The cengkok is usually used to gives hint on how to idomatically
improvise on a given melodic frame. Each of the grid of the player will
contain combinations of this cengkok as a base for improvisation. The
role of the players will be given to the saxophone and clarinet
instruments.</p>

<p>The keyboard instrument will give accompaniment along with the
generative electronic drone. Here, along with the idea of tempo (laya),
I will play with the idea of rhythmic density (irama), i.e., how is the
pulse’s relation to the smallest unit of rhythm played by the
instrument. Repetitions of the ground melodic frame will be given
variation by simply changing the density and the rule of realizing it by
means of the cengkok. A certain stochastic process will be introduced in
the selection of cengkok.</p>

<p>For the digital score, a mixture of the cipher notation common in
Javanese music (Kepatihan notation) and a graphic notation will be used.
This is to make the score more accessible also in the hope to make it
applicable cross-culturally.</p>

<h2 id="technical-implementation">Technical Implementation</h2>

<p>The game interface for the players and the judge will be made with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p5js</code>, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p5.party</code>, a library to create networked multiuser game.
To manage different interface for each performers, the library
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p5.scenemanager</code> will be used. Keeping the festival theme, I purposely
only use web technology to create the electronic music part. I plan to
do research on the possibilities writing music using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p5.sound</code> library,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WebAudioXML</code> parser library, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tone.js</code>. The graphical digital score
will be made using the Python library <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neoscore</code>.</p>

<p>Each of the musician will need a screen for their game board and to
display their digital score. An additional grid interface (Launchpad
MIDI controller or similar) or a tablet with control surface (via, e.g.,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Open Stage Control</code>) is needed to control the grid of the game. For the
musician who joins remotely, they will interact through the browser on
their game board and with system for audio network performance such as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JackTrip</code>.</p>

<p>The audience who are present at the performance space will be able to
see the true location of all the battleships of all players, and the
number of battleships left. In addition, the musician who are performing
remotely will also be shown. For the audience who watch the performance
remotely, the broadcast of that screen and the performance situation
will be shown.</p>

<h2 id="the-performance">The Performance</h2>

<p>The performance is a hybrid one: in person and online. The technical
requirement will be as described above.</p>

<h2 id="time-schedule">Time Schedule</h2>

<p>If the project is to be realized, at least three area of the development
needs to be worked on. First is the composition of music materials,
second is the technical implementation of interfaces and game mechanic,
third is the testing of the sonic materials as well as the technical
implementation. The first area will be done first, primarily between
April-May 2023. The second area will be in May, while the third area
will be between May and early June 2023.</p>
