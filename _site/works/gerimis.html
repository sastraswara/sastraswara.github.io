<h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>

<p>“Nieselregen / Gerimis” is an audio-visual composition based on the work of 
the Indonesian author Triyanto Triwikromo. Similar to our <a href="/works/woman-at-the-end-of-time.html">former collaboration</a>,
I implement distant-reading technique on his texts in order to find “retrieved
information” within the text.</p>

<p>For me, this novel is a process of myth upon myth—
that is, as a connection between levels of symbols and their
meanings. Thus, Auschwitz, Hitler, War, Rape, Seeleninsel and the World of the
Dead in the novel are no longer a matter of chronology, biographical
characters, historical facts, or geographical locations—rather, they are a
labyrinth of life that must be explored as an inner journey to hone our
humanity. As if using the method of ‘theme and variation’ ad absurdum, all the
signs and symbols in the novel appear in diverse forms, inviting a plurality of
meanings.</p>

<p>We presented the text and the audio-visual composition along the graphic works
of Muchammad Salafi Handoyo and the translation of the text by Gudrun Ingratubun
at the Haus der Indonesischen Kulturen in Berlin.</p>

<hr />

<p>The novel ‘Seperti Gerimis Merah di Auschwitz’ (Like Red Drizzle in
Auschwitz) centres on Rutha, a Jewish woman from Gdansk, whose life story
unfolds between Poland and Berlin and tells of pain, survival and humanity.</p>

<p>The event combines literary, musical and visual forms of expression: excerpts
from the novel are read in German translation by Gudrun Ingratubun and the
author himself; composer and musician Bilawa Ade Respati responds to the
symbolic language of the novel with an experimental composition that combines
traditional sounds and algorithmic processes. Between gamelan and digital
synthesis, a sound emerges that captures the spiritual dimension of the
narrative; finally, artist Muchammad Salafi Handoyo presents graphic works
that arose from his intensive engagement with the novel.</p>

<p>In the novel,
Auschwitz is treated not as a historical place, but as a symbolic space – a
myth that connects suffering, resistance and hope across time and cultures.
In text, sound and image, an artistic echo of the book’s central message
unfolds: it is not revenge, but humanity and compassion that show the way out
of trauma.</p>
