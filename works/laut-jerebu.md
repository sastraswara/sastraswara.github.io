laut jerebu (the sea where land is out of sight)

This sharing takes the shape of a conversation between jee chan, Jelena Golubović and Bilawa Ade Respati. Drawing upon our respective lived experiences across Southeast Asia and Southeast Europe, we discuss issues surrounding language, mapping, nationhood and diaspora in relation to the construction of identity. The conversation will be interspersed with moments of song from the Central Javanese gamelan tradition—the context in which the three of us met, as well as a point of reference as we flow through the afternoon. This event marks the end of jee chan’s research residency hosted at Flutgraben Performances (July/August 2023).
