## Project Description

A Play for the Gods, a Play for No Good(?) is a black shadow play and conceptual performance
about invisibility and death. In a dim light, the black-clad puppeteer plays with
(mostly) black figures agains a black shadow puppet screen, accompanied by a soundscape
of newly written gamelan and electronic music.

Through several different stage images, the intangible and incomprehensible death is
potrayed, people who struggle with their lives in silence are celebrated,
attempts are made to recreate the one that was lost, and the meaning of everything is 
questioned. It is an evocative experience where the shadow play is not always easy to see,
while the usually hidden underside is fully visible. The performance is a tribute
to the invisible labour of people.
