## Project Description

This is a continuation of the work [Laut Jerebu]({% link works/laut-jerebu.md %}) 
from 2023. The conversation takes the theme of language, mapping,
nationhood, and diaspora in relation to the construction of identity. The
current social political situation informs the conversation further. Jelena
Golubovic related to her experience demonstrating for the Palestinian people
and dissecting the relation of environmental exploitation to the global
people's resistance. Meanwhile, Bilawa Respati reflected on the efficacy of
spiritual and ethical teaching hallmarks of the classical Javanese song-poem in
the face of cultural pluralism and migration. jee chan presented their thoughts
within the conceptual frame of the work, connecting the two, while interrupting
the pace with singing music from the classical Javanese music repertoire. On
stage, an unplayed gend√©r instrument stood. 

Laut Jerebu was presented in January within the event Choreographic Devices 4
at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. With and by [jee chan](https://www.zuntukyun.com/)
(performing artist) and Jelena Golubovic (researcher).
