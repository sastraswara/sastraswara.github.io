# About

In Figures/Echoes, I want to investigate the connection between movement, dramaturgy, and music in the context of a puppet theater performance, drawing inspirations from Swedish and Indonesian tradition. In addition, I will learn the latest music technology in the subject, and about its ethical considerations. As a musician and composer who uses Javanese Gamelan in contemporary and experimental context, my goal is to develop artistic strategies to compose with consideration to the mentioned elements. Traditions are used as starting points, while technology is a way to augment it. I will learn from and work with [Lisa Björkström](https://transitsthlm.se/en/artists/lisa-bjorkstrom/) (puppeteer), [Urban Wahlstedt](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Wahlstedt) (puppeteer), and [André Holzapfel](https://www.kth.se/profile/holzap/) (associate professor in media technology, KTH Royal Institute of Technology). I am thankful for the support of the Indonesian Embassy in Stockholm by providing Javanese Gamelan music instruments and organizing cultural events.
