After the success of their groundbreaking dance productions (AWAL and REQUIEM |
MANGONGKAL HOLI), choreographer-dancer Ruben Reniers reunites with
composer-performer Bilawa Ade Respati for a bold new creation, inspired by
Sinta’s Trial by Fire from the Ramayana.

Fire is both a force of destruction and purification. As a storyteller, fire
speaks of its deep connection to humanity through rituals, reflecting human
emotions—passion, vigor, humor, and joy. In times when “darkness” predominates,
fire has been a source of truth. Nowadays, in a "brighter" world, the
extraction of energy translates to "power," whether in a capital, scientific,
or political sense. This "power" challenges traditional notions of "truth." In
such a world, can fire still reveal the “truth”? How do we measure the weight
of our actions in a world beyond the gods and noble teachers?

SINTA x DAHANA ignites a dialogue that transcends boundaries between tradition
and modernity, as well as between movement and sound. A visual experience that
burns bright.
