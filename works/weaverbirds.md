During the CTM Festival 2025, I joined the artistic lab Resynthesizing the
Traditional as a fellow, hosted by Susie Ibara and Stas Shärifulá. The lab 

> is designed as an open toolbox for artists studying their heritage,
> intended to help them navigate their practice outside of (self-)exoticisation
> and the uneven power dynamics created by mass-cultural and other stereotypes.
> Evoking resynthesis—a processing method in computer music that analyzes sounds
> to extract their fundamental components—as a guiding metaphor, the lab also
> invites participants to confront conservative views of culture as something
> frozen, solidified, and generally untouchable, thus resistant to any
> transformative practices.
> 
> By recognising the »traditional« as a dynamic phenomenon and treating it with
> proper care and respect, the lab will offer a triangular approach to
> »resynthesis« presenting it as a tool for the aesthetic, technological, and
> political transformation of cultures and societies.

During this lab, I continue to work further within the conceptual framework of
dialectics between tradition and innovation. Through spectral analysis and
onset detections, I try to interpolate the continuous singing of the
weaverbirds into the discrete tuning of the gamelan. This is both an echo and a
homage to the classical gamelan piece "Manyar Sewu" (Thousand Weaverbirds).
The usage of the automaton as a musical partner further enhanced my
improvisatory practice. The rigidity of the algorithm and the precision of the
machine are answered with its stochastic elements---providing me with a good
balance of sturdy musical structure and surprising elements that incite
creativity. I seek the sharpness of a moment, where a musical idea flashes in a
split second to be captured and realized by the body, along with all the risk
of performing it in a live situation.

During the public presentations, I joined two "Encounters" on stage. The first
was to respond to the lecture performance of meLê yamomo, "Tumrap susilaning
gěndhing winor laguning lělagon [redux]", and the second was an improvisational
set with Shoty Ndjoli. Both are a musical experience where ideas forged during
the lab were tested before an audience.
