## Project Description

Dream Sequence is a research project of the lighting designer Emese Csornai. In this research project, she investigates the possibility of transfering the dream sequence, as a device in film, to the theater space. Her guiding questions: "Is film's dream to get into the world of theater? And is the theater trying to get into the clothes of film, adverstising itself as something comprehendable on a screen?" For her, dream sequence enables us as audience to disappear in the protagonist's head with a language more abstract than the rest of the film. In this research we also dive into the realm of pop culture, dreams, and the rhythm of a contemporary life.
